<a name="createMaterialDialog"></a>

#### i. Google Nav Bar

`Dialogs` class will be used to create your dialog, below is an example to show your dialog in the app.

```dart
GNav(
    backgroundColor: Constants.appColor,
    rippleColor: Colors.grey[300]!,
    hoverColor: Colors.grey[100]!,
    gap: 8,
    activeColor: Constants.appColor,
    iconSize: 24,
    haptic: false,
    padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 20, vertical: 12),
    duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 400),
    tabBackgroundColor: Colors.grey[100]!,
    tabMargin: const EdgeInsets.all(5),
    color: Colors.white,
    tabs: iconList,
    selectedIndex: _selectedIndex,
    onTabChange: (index) {
        setState(() {
        _selectedIndex = index;
        });
    },
    ),
```

# Limitations

it's better to make your animation to have the same background color as your dialog's background color, please use [lottie editor](https://lottiefiles.com/editor) to remove the background layer of your animation or make it same as your dialog background color before using it in the plugin.
